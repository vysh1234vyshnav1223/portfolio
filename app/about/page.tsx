              I didnâ€™t exactly set out to become a digital marketer. I kind of stumbled into it. But once I realized the fun part, there was no going back.

            <br />
            <span>
              Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve worked primarily in the organic growth side of marketing (SEO, Content, Social Media, and Marketing Operations).
              Iâ€™ve been building systems that get attention and convert. From optimizing blogs that drive traffic to building internal tools using no-code platforms,
              I love tinkering with things until they just work smarter.
            </span>

            <br />
            <span>
              Most recently, Iâ€™ve been diving into performance marketing to complete the paid side of the growth puzzle. I also enjoy automating workflows,
              processes, and manual tasks, the kind that save hours of repetitive work for my team.
            </span>
            <br />
            <br />
            <span>
              Iâ€™m not here to throw jargon or buzzwords. I like building cool stuff, sharing what I learn, and chasing wins. One experiment at a time.

              <li>Help teams focus on meaningful decisions â€” not manual tasks through automation.</li>
              <li>Become a full-stack growth marketer who doesnâ€™t rely on just one channel to drive results.</li>
